# Dog Age Calculator

Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

## Age Calculation

- The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
- Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

## Usage

To use the dog age calculator, you can follow these steps:

1. Input your age in human years.
2. The calculator will convert it to dog years according to the rules mentioned above.

## Example

If you're 25 years old, in dog years you'd be:

10.5 (for the first year) + 10.5 (for the second year) + 4 * (25 - 2) = 89 dog years

Feel free to use this calculator to find out how old you'd be if you were a dog!
